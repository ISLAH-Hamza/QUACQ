# QUACQ ‚Äì Constraint Acquisition Implementation  

This repository provides an **implementation of the QUACQ algorithm** for **constraint acquisition**.  
QUACQ is an interactive learning method designed to acquire constraints of a target problem through **queries** to an oracle (user or simulated system).  

**Original paper:** [QUACQ: A System for Constraint Acquisition](https://hal.science/lirmm-04028358/)

## üîç Overview  

- **Purpose:** Learn constraints of a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) from examples, without requiring the complete model beforehand.  
- **Algorithm:** Implements the **QUACQ** method, which iteratively generates examples, queries an oracle, and narrows down the possible constraint set.  
- **Solver:** Uses [OR-Tools CP-SAT solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization) for satisfiability checks.  
- **Relations Supported:**  
  - Unary: `==val`, `!=val`, `<val`, `<=val`, `>val`, `>=val`  
  - Binary: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`  
  - Distance-based: `||==val`, `||!=val`, `||<val`, `||<=val`, `||>val`, `||>=val`
